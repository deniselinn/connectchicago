# Contributing to Connect Chicago

Thanks for your interest in Connect Chicago. We hope that you'll consider contributing your voice/skills to this digital inclusion work. :tada: Here's some context:

> Connect Chicago is a citywide digital inclusion initaitive. We're working with nonprofit partners, advocates, and community members in 2017 to identify gaps in access & training resources across the city so we can cobuild & support solutions to fill those gaps. In 2017, we're undertaking collaborative work to scan our ecosystem, centralize our existing assets and identify community-driven digital inclusion ideas/solutions.

All are welcome here. Please read our contributor guildelines so you'll know how to not only lend your expertise to this work, but also empower others to do the same. This guide is meant to make it easy for you to get involved. This project aims to be accessible to online AND offline contributors with a wide array of skill sets. 

Note that this guide also exists [in this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i5wNbN9oOoA19fY1Tk0tPcngQqqwVuvK8_offfs3ae8/edit?usp=sharing). We made this design decision because we wanted to meet our contributors where they were and many are not on GitHub, which is perfectly fine! 

## Participation guidelines

## How to submit changes

Online contributions are very welcome! Our goal is to make it as easy as possible contribute ideas, content, and questions to Connect Chicago online. 

There are two ways to contribute to Connect Chicago work online:
1. [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cGyplc4Gyi2gqMWyggDiEgTEJwYwfgJgZwQfQ8on7gY/edit#heading=h.kaq4mfmb8ts2) - contributors can insert text and comments while chatting with other contributors. 
1. GitHub - contributors can respond to “issues” (you’ll find the same ones on the [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cGyplc4Gyi2gqMWyggDiEgTEJwYwfgJgZwQfQ8on7gY/edit#heading=h.kaq4mfmb8ts2)) or create their own. 

Why are we using both Google docs and GitHub? Since this particular collaborative work isn’t technical and so many of our contributors are not on GitHub, we wanted to make sure there was a home base for collaboration that was familiar to our existing collaboration community: [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cGyplc4Gyi2gqMWyggDiEgTEJwYwfgJgZwQfQ8on7gY/edit#heading=h.kaq4mfmb8ts2). That being said, if people would like to participate on GitHub or learn how to use GitHub, here is information about how to set up a free GitHub account and sign in. Here are some [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) for how to use GitHub.
